## Electronic Supporting File Repository

**Authors:** Gabriela B. Correa, Eliseo Marin-Rimoldi, Frederico W. Tavares, and Edward J. Maginn

This repository contains the supporting files for the article:  
**_Active Learning for Transport Property Prediction in CO₂–Hydrocarbon Systems: A Multi-Fidelity Approach Integrating Molecular Dynamics and Experiments_**

Each main folder is organized into subdirectories corresponding to the binary and ternary systems studied:  
**CO₂/n-heptane**, **CO₂/benzene**, **toluene/n-hexane**, and **CO₂/ethanol/dibenzyl ether**.

The repository is divided into two main folders:

1. **`Active_Learning/`**
   - Experimental and MD datasets  
   - Multi-fidelity active learning scripts (combined MD and experiments) 
   - Single-fidelity active learning scripts (MD-only or experiments-only)

2. **`MD_Simulations/`**
   - Force field topology and parameter files  
   - LAMMPS input scripts  
   - Python scripts for calculating mutual diffusivity and viscosity
